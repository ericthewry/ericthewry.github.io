  <h4> Abstract </h4>

  <p>Temporal logics over finite traces are not the same as temporal logics over potentially infinite traces. We propose that existing methods for proving deductive completeness for infinite-trace logics are effective on their finite counterparts. To adapt proofs for infinite-trace logics, we “inject” finiteness: that is, we alter the proof structure to ensure that models are finite. As evidence for this claim, we offer deduc- tive completeness results for two finite temporal logics: linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf) and linear dynamic logic over finite traces (LDLf). Both proofs of completeness follow a conventional, graph based, least fixed point structure. Roşu first proved completeness for (LTLf) with a novel coinductive axiom; our proof uses fewer and more conventional axioms (2016). The proof for LDLf is novel; it largely follows our LTLf proof, using Brzozowski derivatives to define a transition function.</p>
