  <h4> Abstract </h4>

  <p>P4Cub is a new intermediate representation (IR) for the P4 programming language that is designed to facilitate the development of certified tools. It is organized around a small set of core constructs that avoid complexities found in the surface language such as side effects in expressions, mutual recursion between the expressions and statements, and so on. Still, P4Cub retains the essential domain-specific features of P4 itself. P4Cub has a front-end based on Petr4, and has been fully mechanized in Coq including big-step and small-step semantics and a type system. We have built several certified tools using P4Cub including a type soundness proof, a compiler pass, and an automated verification tool.</p>
