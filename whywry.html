Why is my Github handle <code>ericthewry</code>?
</h1>
<p>I wanted my Github handle to somehow pertain to the meaning of my name. I’d seen many other Github handles that were initials, names, numbers, partial names, and I was hoping to get something a little bit different. Here’s how I got to <code>ericthewry</code>.</p>
<p>I was hoping to make my handle mean exactly what my name, <em>Eric Hayden Campbell</em>, means, i.e. <em>everlasting/honored ruler</em> (Eric) <em>heathen</em> (Hayden) and <em>wry-mouthed</em> (Campbell). To me, the handle <code>ericthewry</code> seemed like a concise intimiation, using a near-literal meaning of my last name (<code>wry</code> instead of <em>wry-mouthed</em>, and a naming convention common to everlasting (in memory at least) historical leaders – Attila The Hun, Ivan the Terrible, and now Eric the Wry. I decided to leave out the socially-charged <em>heathen</em> for simplicity.</p>
<p>However, ever since I created the handle, almost every one of my peer collaborators has asked me what in God’s name <code>ericthewry</code> actually means, and why I chose something so absurd. So, I guess while I thought I was being clever, I just ended up sounded cryptic and pretentious. Unfortunately, now I’m stuck with it.</p>
<p>A list of just as annoying and just as obtuse alternatives</p>
<ul>
<li><code>theonceandfutureking</code></li>
<li><code>highlandrule</code></li>
<li><code>everlast</code> (yeah I know its a band)</li>
<li><code>wry</code></li>
<li><code>rye</code> (BREAD!)</li>
<li><code>wryclan</code> (<em>Campbell</em> is the name of a Scottish clan)</li>
<li><code>odinswry</code> (referencing the Nordic origins of the name <em>Eric</em>)</li>
<li><code>wryheart</code> (like <em>Braveheart</em>, get it? get it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably should have just gone with something like <code>ehc</code> or <code>ecamp</code> or <code>ehcampbell</code> or something much more normal.</p>
