	  <h1 id="why-is-my-github-handle-ericthewry">Why is my Github handle <code>ericthewry</code>?</h1>
<p>I wanted to make my handle intimiate the literal meaning of my full name: <em>Eric Hayden Campbell</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric – <em>everlasting/honored ruler</em></li>
<li>Hayden – <em>heathen</em></li>
<li>Campbell – <em>wry-mouthed</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The handle <code>ericthewry</code> seemed like a concise way to suggest each of these meanings. Using a near-literal meaning of my last name (<code>wry</code> instead of <em>wry-mouthed</em>), and a naming convention common to everlasting (in memory at least) historical leaders – Attila The Hun, Ivan the Terrible, Alexander the Great – many of whom were themselves heathens.</p>
<p>However, ever since I created the handle, almost every one of my peer collaborators has asked me what in god’s name <code>ericthewry</code> actually means, and why I chose something so absurd. Someone once asked me what “Eric ther wee” meant…</p>
<p>In hindsight, I probably should have just gone with something like <code>ehc</code> or <code>ecamp</code> or <code>ehcampbell</code>. Ah well..</p>
