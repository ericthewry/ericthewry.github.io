Reasoning about network programs is challenging because of how they divide la-
bor: the control plane computes high level routes through the network and compiles
them to device configurations, while the data plane uses these configurations to re-
alize the desired forwarding behavior. In practice, the correctness of the data plane
often assumes that the configurations generated by the control plane will satisfy
complex specifications. These specifications are either missing or maintained in
complex English language documents, which makes correctly configuring devices
hard.
This thesis tackles this problem from three angles. First, we present algorithms
for computing control plane interface specifications that ensure the safety of the
data plane. These specifications can be used to improve the safety and quality of
both the control plane and of the data plane. Then, we show how to automat-
ically generate configurations for data plane programs, and finally, we conclude
with a semantic framework for programming and relational verification of pairs of
configurable programs.
