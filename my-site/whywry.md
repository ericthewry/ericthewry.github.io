<h1>Why is my Github handle  <code>ericthewry</code>? </h1>

I wanted my Github handle to somehow pertain to the meaning of my
name. I'd seen many other Github handles that were initials, names,
numbers, partial names, and I was hoping to get something a little bit
different. Here's how I got to `ericthewry`.

I was hoping to make my handle mean exactly what my name, *Eric Hayden
Campbell*, means, i.e.  *everlasting/honored ruler* (Eric) *heathen*
(Hayden) and *wry-mouthed* (Campbell). To me, the handle `ericthewry`
seemed like a concise intimiation, using a near-literal meaning of my
last name (`wry` instead of *wry-mouthed*, and a naming convention
common to everlasting (in memory at least) historical leaders --
Attila The Hun, Ivan the Terrible, and now Eric the Wry. I decided to
leave out the socially-charged *heathen* for simplicity.

However, ever since I created the handle, almost every one of my peer
collaborators has asked me what in God's name `ericthewry` actually
means, and why I chose something so absurd. So, I guess while I
thought I was being clever, I just ended up sounded cryptic and
pretentious. Unfortunately, now I'm stuck with it.

A list of just as annoying and just as obtuse alternatives

- `theonceandfutureking` 
- `highlandrule`
- `everlast` (yeah I know its a band)
- `wry`
- `rye` (BREAD!)
- `wryclan` (*Campbell* is the name of a Scottish clan)
- `odinswry` (referencing the Nordic origins of the name *Eric*)
- `wryheart` (like *Braveheart*, get it? get it?)


I probably should have just gone with something like `ehc` or `ecamp`
or `ehcampbell` or something much more normal.
