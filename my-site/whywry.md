## Why is my Github handle `ericthewry`?

I wanted my Github handle to somehow pertain to the meaning of my
name. I’d seen many other Github handles that were initials, names,
numbers, partial names, and I was hoping to get something a little bit
different. Here’s how I got to `ericthewry`.

I was hoping to make my handle mean exactly what my name, *Eric Hayden
Campbell*, means, i.e. *everlasting/honored ruler* (Eric) *heathen*
(Hayden) and *wry-mouthed* (Campbell). To me, the handle 1ericthewry1
seemed like a concise intimiation, using a near-literal meaning of my
last name (<code>wry</code> instead of <em>wry-mouthed</em>, and a
naming convention common to everlasting (in memory at least)
historical leaders – Attila The Hun, Ivan the Terrible, and now Eric
the Wry. I decided to leave out the socially-charged <em>heathen</em>
for simplicity.

However, ever since I created the handle, almost every one of my peer
collaborators has asked me what in God’s name `ericthewry` actually
means, and why I chose something so absurd. Someone once asked me what
"Eric ther Wie" meant. So, I guess while I thought I was being clever,
I just ended up sounded cryptic and pretentious. Unfortunately, now
I’m stuck with it.

Here's a list of just as annoying and just as obtuse alternatives

- `theonceandfutureking`
- `everlast` (yeah I know its a band)
- `rye` (BREAD!)
- `odinswry` (referencing the Nordic origins of the name *Eric*)
- `wryheart` (like `Braveheart`, get it? get it?)

In hindsight, I probably should have just gone with something
like <code>ehc</code> or <code>ecamp</code> or <code>ehcampbell</code>
or something standard
