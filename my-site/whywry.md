# Why is my Github handle `ericthewry`?

I wanted to make my handle intimiate the literal meaning of my full
name: _Eric Hayden Campbell_.

+ Eric -- *everlasting/honored ruler* 
+ Hayden -- *heathen*
+ Campbell -- *wry-mouthed* 

The handle `ericthewry` seemed like a concise way to suggest each of
these meanings. Using a near-literal meaning of my last name (`wry`
instead of _wry-mouthed_), and a naming convention common to
everlasting (in memory at least) historical leaders – Attila The Hun,
Ivan the Terrible, Alexander the Great – many of whom were themselves
heathens.

However, ever since I created the handle, almost every one of my peer
collaborators has asked me what in god’s name `ericthewry` actually
means, and why I chose something so absurd. Someone once asked me what
"Eric ther wee" meant...

In hindsight, I probably should have just gone with something like
`ehc` or `ecamp` or `ehcampbell`. Ah well..
