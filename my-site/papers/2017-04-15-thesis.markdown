We present sound and complete axiomatic framework for Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf ), as well as a decision procedure.
Our work is founded completeness proofs for LTL [Kroger and
Merz. 2008], Past-time framings, [Lichtenstein et al. 1985], and
anchored frameworks [Manna and Pnueli. 1988]. Further we rely on the
an extant axiomatization of LTLf [Becket et al. 2016] and an extant
semantics [DeGiacomo and Vardi. 2013,2015,2016]. Our approach follows
the least fixpoint method for LTL completeness and decidability given
in [Kroger and Merz 2016], using insights about finitude
presented. Finally, the completeness of LTLf extends the partial
completeness proof for Temporal Netkat to a full completeness result.
