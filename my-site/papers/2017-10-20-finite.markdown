Temporal logics over finite traces are not the same as temporal logics over
potentially infinite traces. We propose that existing methods for proving
deductive completeness for infinite-trace logics are effective on their finite
counterparts. To adapt proofs for infinite-trace logics, we “inject” finiteness:
that is, we alter the proof structure to ensure that models are finite. As
evidence for this claim, we offer deduc- tive completeness results for two
finite temporal logics: linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf) and
linear dynamic logic over finite traces (LDLf). Both proofs of completeness
follow a conventional, graph based, least fixed point structure. Roşu first
proved completeness for (LTLf) with a novel coinductive axiom; our proof uses
fewer and more conventional axioms (2016). The proof for LDLf is novel; it
largely follows our LTLf proof, using Brzozowski derivatives to define a
transition function.
