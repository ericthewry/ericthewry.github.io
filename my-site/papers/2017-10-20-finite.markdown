Temporal logics over finite traces are not the same as temporal logics
over potentially infinite traces [2,6,5]. Rosu first proved
completeness for linear temporal logic on finite traces
(LTL<sub>f</sub>) with a novel coinductive axiom [13]. We offer a
different proof, with fewer and more conventional axioms. our proof is
a direct adaptation of Kr\"oger and Merz' proof [10]. the essense of
our adaption is that we "inject" finiteness: that is, we alter the
proof structure to ensure that models are finite.
