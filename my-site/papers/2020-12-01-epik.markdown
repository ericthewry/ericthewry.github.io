--- 

Constructive and computable multi-agent epistemic possible worlds
models are defined, where possible worlds models are guarded string
models in an epistemic extension of Kleene Algebra with Tests. The
account is framed as a formal language Epik (Epistemic KAT) for
defining such models. The language is implemented by translation into
the finite state calculus and alternatively by modeling propositions
as lazy lists in Haskell. The syntax-semantics interface for a
fragment of English is defined by a categorial grammar.
