Temporal logics over finite traces are not the same as temporal logics over potentially infinite traces. Roşu first proved completeness for linear temporal logic on finite traces (LTLf) with a novel coinductive axiom. We offer a different proof, with fewer, more conventional axioms. Our proof is a direct adaptation of Kröger and Merz's Henkin-Hasenjaeger-style proof. The essence of our adaption is that we "inject" finiteness: that is, we alter the proof structure to ensure that models are finite. We aim to present a thorough, accessible proof.
