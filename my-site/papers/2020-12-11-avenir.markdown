The classical conception of software-defined networking (SDN) is based
on an attractive myth: a logically centralized controller manages a
collection of homogeneous data planes. In reality, however, SDN
control planes must deal with significant diversity in hardware,
drivers, interfaces, and protocols, all of which contribute to
idiosyncratic differences in forwarding behavior that must be dealt
with by hand.

To manage this heterogeneity, we propose Avenir, a synthesis tool
that automatically generates control-plane operations to ensure
uniform behavior across a variety of data planes. Our approach builds
on ideas such as counter-example guided inductive synthesis and
sketching, adding network-specific optimizations that exploit domain
insights to accelerate the search. We prove that Avenir's synthesis
algorithm only generates correct solutions and always finds a
solution, if one exists. We have built a prototype implementation
of Avenir using OCaml and Z3 and evaluated its performance on
realistic scenarios for the ONOS SDN controller as well as a
collection of benchmarks that quantify the cost of retargetting a
control-plane from one pipeline to another. Our evaluation
demonstrates that Avenir can be used to manage data plane
heterogeneity with modest overheads.
