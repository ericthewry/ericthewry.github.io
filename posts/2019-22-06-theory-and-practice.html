<p>Computer Science is a unique discipline when it comes to the tension between theory and practice. In most of the sciences – most notably Physics comes to mind – a common refrain is “that works in theory, but not in practice”. However, in computer science, we have a different tension, where problems are often theoretically intractable or unsolvable, but are, in practice, solved every day in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>A classic example of this is that parsing C++ programs is actually undecidable, since its template system is Turing complete. However, C++ programs are parsed (and executed) on a daily basis… In fact, it is one of the leading languages for systems research. The problem is theoretically unsolvable, but practically quite fast.</p>
<p>This week at Cornell, my research group hosted <a href="http://network-programming.org/wfr/">a workshop</a> that brought together experts on packet routing from around the world. Theoreticians and Practitioners alike (and everyone in between) got together to discuss data plane routing protocols, probabilistic verification tools, performant dynamic routing algorithms, static/oblivious routing, low-latency WAN routing, and many other cool routing concepts. Most of the work presented in this workshop relied on, exploited or explored this strange tension between the theoretical and the practical.</p>
<p>The main theme that stuck with me across all of the research talks was that oftentimes the theoretical worst-case or average-case bounds don’t capture how well we can do in practice. Perhaps the research was organized so neatly because much of it was funded by the same grant, the <em>Algorithms in the Field</em> NSF grant, designed to fund both practical systems guided by theoretical algorithms and theoretical algorithms motivated by practical applications.</p>
<p>I think the cleanest example of the tension between the theoretical and the practical was between Harald Räcke’s talk on Compact Demand-Oblivious Routing, and Praveen Kumar’s talk on Semi-Oblivious Routing. Räcke presented a series of complicated routing schemes based on his <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1181881">2002</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hari/routing.pdf">2008</a> papers that provided theoretical bounds on the latency in the network. He also discussed more recent work on <em>Compact Oblivious Routing</em>, a variation on the problem that tries to minimize the number of forwarding rules installed on each switch.</p>
<p>All of the papers discuss an on-line algorithm, that is, routing decisions are processed as the sequence <code>σ</code> of requests (e.g. <code>GET</code> or <code>PUT</code>) are issued. To theoretically bound evaluate the performance of these algorithms, they compare their result against the optimal offline algorithm, which can view all requests in advance, and derive a routing scheme with <em>total</em> information. Räcke explained the O(<code>log n</code>) competitive algorithm, and explained that no algorithm could do better than <code>Ω(√(log n))</code>.</p>
<p>Immediately after, Kumar presented his work, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~praveenk/papers/smore-anrw18.pdf">SMORE</a>, that combined Räcke’s early work on oblivious routing with an interfering controller that dynamically recalculated edge weights so that route selection could be done semi-dynamically, providing near-optimal traffic engineering performance. He explained that the congestion, latency, and throughput for the online SMORE routing scheme was either equal to the offline optimal performance or within 5-15 of optimal. He also showed consistently better performance than pure oblivious routing schemes and many other well-known routing schemes (such as FCC).</p>
<p>This is bonkers! – but not entirely unsurprising in computer science. By focusing on the average case, Kumar was able to develop an extensive framework that, in practice, outperformed the theoretical state-of-the-art. This tension in Computer Science is common – Algorithms may be just barely feasible in theory, but then in practice are exceptionally performant.</p>
<p>I’m curious about the pathological cases. Since SMORE is only semi-oblivious, it <em>may</em> not be held to the <code>Ω(√(log n))</code>-competitive performance bound the pure oblivious networks are held to – on which networks and which sequences <code>σ</code> does SMORE perform badly? on which does it perform exceptionally?</p>
<p>In keeping with these questions, SMORE is a perfect marriage of theoretical computer science and experimental computer science. It is systems research motivated by and deeply grounded in theory. This is the kind of Systems Research programme that really excites me. Maybe that’s why I’m working with Nate..?</p>
<p>Also, props to whoever came up with the schedule (Nate? Jen? Praveen? Jenna?) — during the Q&amp;A portion of Räcke’s talk, many of the attending systems researchers were very curious to know how Oblivious Routing schemes fared in practice. And then lo! up walked Praveen, graphs in hand, ready to answer exactly that question…</p>
